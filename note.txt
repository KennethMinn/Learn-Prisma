#type modifier 
-there is only two type modifiers -> ? and []

*when i save the prisma schema, the first model(independent model) which is written relation field first wont have foreign id, it will add to the other model(dependent mode)

***** Important to understand ******
-the model that has relation @attribute is a dependent model

#Correct Usage

//independent model
model User {
   id    String @id @default(uuid())
   posts Post[] // user has many posts - when the user is deleted, post should be deleted too
}

//dependent model
model Post  {
   id        String @id @default(uuid())   

   //a post has an author
   author    User   @relation(fields : [authorId], references : [id], onDelete : Cascade) // Post will be deleted when the user is deleted
   authorId  String
}
